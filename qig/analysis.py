"""
High-level analysis helpers for the quantum inaccessible game.

At this stage this module is a placeholder. As part of CIP-0001, reusable
analysis functions from `advanced_analysis.py` and related scripts can be
factored into this module so that experiments and notebooks can import
from `qig.analysis` rather than depending on script internals.
