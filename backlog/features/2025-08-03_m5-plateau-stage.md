# Task: Implement M-5: Stage 3 Long Plateau & Quasi-Symmetries

## Description

Implement the Stage 3 Long Plateau & Quasi-Symmetries subsection that shows how Fisher eigenvalue hierarchy leads to metastable plateaus and emergent quasi-symmetries, including the Lorentz dispersion relation and SU(3)→SU(2)×U(1) symmetry breaking.

## Background

The plateau stage is where the system reaches metastable configurations with emergent quasi-symmetries. This stage connects the abstract mathematical framework to concrete physical phenomena, showing how fundamental constants and particle-like behavior emerge from Fisher geometry.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Plateau Formation
- [x] ✅ *Enhanced electroweak analysis*: Comprehensive information-geometric framework for fine structure constant *(COMPLETED 2025-08-01)*
- [x] ✅ *Consolidated "Classical Emergence"* → "Information Flow Optimization" *(COMPLETED 2025-08-01)*
- [x] ✅ *Focus on sloppy Fisher modes* and effective SU(2)×U(1) *(COMPLETED 2025-08-01)*
- [x] ✅ *Present approximate charges* and conservation laws *(COMPLETED 2025-08-01)*
- [ ] Show Lorentz dispersion ω² = c²k² + m²
- [ ] **NEW**: Add "Parameters Become Constants" subsection (Section 5.X) showing eigenvalue ratios → α, c, etc.
