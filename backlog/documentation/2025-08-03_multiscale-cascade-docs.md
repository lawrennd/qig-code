# Task: Polish and Integrate “Multi-Scale Cascade Dynamics” Section

## Description
A raw comment block (≈150 lines) describing multi-scale cascade dynamics and info-geometric Hawkes processes was dropped into `the-inaccessible-game.tex`. This needs to be converted into polished manuscript prose.

## Sub-tasks
1. Rewrite comment into narrative paragraphs with clear motivation and links to earlier sections.
2. Ensure equations compile; move to proper `\begin{align}` or `equation` environments.
3. Add illustrative figure or schematic if helpful.
4. Cross-reference any new results, update Table&nbsp;?? placeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Section is readable, concise (<6 pages).
- [ ] All equations compile and are referenced.
- [ ] No leftover `\begin{comment}` blocks for this material.
