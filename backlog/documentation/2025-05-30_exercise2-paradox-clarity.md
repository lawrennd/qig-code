# Task: Improve Exercise 2 Paradox Explanation Clarity

## Description

Exercise 2, Part (i) asks students to explain the "paradoxical situation" at the origin point where S(Z) = 0. The solutions commentary suggests the hint could be more explicit about what makes this situation "paradoxical."

**Current hint**: "Think about what this means: each individual variable appears maximally uncertain, yet the system as a whole is perfectly determined."

**Improvement needed**: Make it clearer why this is paradoxical and what philosophical/conceptual tensions this creates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enhance the hint to explicitly state why the situation is paradoxical
- [ ] Add clarification about the tension between individual uncertainty and global determinism
- [ ] Possibly add a brief note about how this connects to quantum measurement paradoxes
- [ ] Ensure the improved hint guides students toward the core conceptual insight

## Implementation Notes

**Potential enhanced hint approaches:**
1. Emphasize the apparent contradiction: "How can variables be simultaneously maximally uncertain individually yet perfectly determined collectively?"
2. Connect to everyday experience: "This is like each person in a crowd being unpredictable individually, yet the crowd's behavior being perfectly determined"
3. Link to quantum foundations: "This mirrors the measurement problem in quantum mechanics"
