# Task: Write Complete Solutions for Exercise 7: Gradient Flow Dynamics

## Description

Exercise 7 "Gradient Flow Dynamics and Partition Emergence" is completely missing from the solutions file, despite being claimed in the title "Complete Solutions (Exercises 1-8)". This is a substantial, advanced exercise with 4 multi-part questions covering:

- Maximum entropy production → gradient flow dynamics
- Fisher metric weighting of entropy gradients  
- Resolution limits and critical slowing
- Hierarchical partition emergence from flow dynamics

**Current Status**: Solution does not exist at all.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete mathematical solutions for all 4 parts (i-iv)
- [ ] Detailed derivations showing $\frac{d\theta}{d\tau} = -G(\theta)\theta$
- [ ] Clear explanations of Fisher information geometry connections
- [ ] Physical interpretation of resolution limits and quasi-equilibrium
- [ ] Demonstration of hierarchical partition emergence
- [ ] Commentary section analyzing exercise strengths/improvements
- [ ] Cross-references to Exercises 5-6 (distinguishability/exponential families)

## Implementation Notes

**Mathematical Content Required**:
- Exponential family entropy derivatives
- Fisher information matrix properties  
- Information geometry on parameter manifolds
- Gradient flow analysis with resolution limits
- Critical phenomena (diverging relaxation times)

**Connections to Establish**:
- Exercise 5: distinguishability and Fisher geometry
- Exercise 6: exponential families and natural parameters
- Links to statistical mechanics and phase transitions

**Level**: Advanced graduate-level information geometry and statistical physics.
