# Task: Write Complete Solutions for Exercise 8: Action Principles and Information Dynamics

## Description

Exercise 8 "Action Principles and Information Dynamics" is completely missing from the solutions file, despite being claimed in the title "Complete Solutions (Exercises 1-8)". This is the most advanced exercise, connecting the information game to:

- Frieden's Extreme Physical Information (EPI) principle
- Action principles and variational mechanics
- Coordinate transformations between entropy time τ and geometric time t
- Emergence of energy conservation from entropy conservation

**Current Status**: Solution does not exist at all.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete mathematical solutions for all 3 parts (i-iii)
- [ ] Clear explanation of entropy time τ vs geometric time t distinction
- [ ] Detailed coordinate transformation showing dt = √|G(θ)| dτ
- [ ] Derivation of unified action form with kinetic + potential terms
- [ ] Connection to Frieden's EPI in appropriate limits
- [ ] Physical interpretation of emergent energy conservation
- [ ] Commentary section analyzing exercise strengths/improvements
- [ ] Cross-references to Exercise 7 (gradient flows) and Exercise 5 (geometry)

## Implementation Notes

**Mathematical Content Required**:
- Variational calculus and action principles
- Coordinate transformations in information geometry
- Fisher information and EPI theory
- Lagrangian mechanics emergence from information dynamics
- Connections between different time coordinates

**Key Philosophical Points**:
- Entropy conservation as fundamental (τ coordinate)
- Energy conservation as emergent (t coordinate)  
- Information geometry as bridge between quantum and classical
- EPI as special case of more general information optimization

**Connections to Establish**:
- Exercise 7: gradient flow dynamics in entropy time
- Exercise 5: Fisher geometry and distinguishability
- Exercise 6: exponential families and natural parameters
- Links to foundational physics and variational principles

**Level**: Research-level theoretical physics and information theory.
