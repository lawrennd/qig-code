# Task: Complete CIP-0004 Developer Documentation

## Description

CIP-0004 (Comprehensive Test Suite Rewrite with Rigorous Tolerances) has been successfully implemented with all core functionality complete. The remaining work items are supplementary documentation materials to help future developers:

1. **Migration Guide**: How to write new tests using the tolerance framework
2. **Training Materials**: Understanding tolerance selection and categories

These documentation items were deferred from the main CIP-0004 implementation and are tracked here as a separate, lower-priority task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Migration Guide Created** (`docs/cip0004_migration_guide.md`)
  - [ ] Step-by-step guide for writing new tests
  - [ ] Examples of converting old-style tests to tolerance framework
  - [ ] Common patterns and anti-patterns
  - [ ] How to choose between Categories A-F
  - [ ] When to use absolute vs relative tolerances

- [ ] **Training Materials Created** (`docs/cip0004_training.md`)
  - [ ] Visual guide to tolerance categories
  - [ ] Decision tree for tolerance selection
  - [ ] Worked examples from actual test suite
  - [ ] FAQ section addressing common questions
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide for test failures

- [ ] **Quick Reference Card** (`docs/cip0004_quick_reference.md`)
  - [ ] One-page tolerance category summary
  - [ ] Code snippets for common test patterns
  - [ ] Links to detailed documentation

## Implementation Notes

Currently these files are named with cip0004 as prefix but that should be changes. It references plans that are not relevant for the user.

### Existing Documentation (already complete):
- `docs/cip0004_precision_analysis.md` - Mathematical derivations
- `docs/cip0004_test_inventory.md` - Test suite inventory
- `tests/tolerance_framework.py` - Inline API documentation

### New Documentation Structure:
```
docs/
├── cip0004_precision_analysis.md     [✅ Complete]
├── cip0004_test_inventory.md         [✅ Complete]
├── cip0004_migration_guide.md        [📝 To Create]
├── cip0004_training.md                [📝 To Create]
└── cip0004_quick_reference.md         [📝 To Create]
```

### Content Strategy:
- Focus on **practical usage** rather than theory
- Include **real examples** from the actual test suite
- Provide **copy-paste templates** for common scenarios
- Link to precision analysis for mathematical details
- Keep quick reference to one page for easy printing

### Integration with CIP-0005 (Sphinx Documentation):
When CIP-0005 is implemented, these markdown docs should be converted to reStructuredText and integrated into the Sphinx documentation structure:
- Migration guide → `docs/source/development/testing_tolerances.rst`
- Training materials → Part of developer guide
- Quick reference → Sidebar/appendix in Sphinx docs
- Precision analysis → `docs/source/development/tolerance_theory.rst`

## Related

- **CIP**: 0004 (Implemented)
- **CIP**: 0005 (Sphinx Documentation - Proposed) - These CIP-0004 docs should be integrated into Sphinx
- **Backlog**: `2025-11-25_cip-0004-test-suite-rewrite.md` (Completed)
- **Documentation**: 
  - Existing: `docs/cip0004_precision_analysis.md`
  - Existing: `docs/cip0004_test_inventory.md`
  - Existing: `tests/tolerance_framework.py` (inline docs)
  - Future: Should be migrated to `docs/source/development/testing_tolerances.rst` when CIP-0005 is implemented

## Progress Updates

### 2025-12-01

Task created to track remaining documentation work from CIP-0004. Core implementation is complete:
- ✅ 9 consolidated test files
- ✅ Tolerance framework fully functional
- ✅ Mathematical analysis documented
- ✅ Test inventory catalogued

Remaining work is purely documentation to improve developer experience.
