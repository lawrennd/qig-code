# CIP-0002: Information-Theoretic Bounds and Thermodynamic Constraints

## Summary
This CIP investigates the fundamental connections between information-theoretic bounds (Shannon's theorems) and thermodynamic constraints on information processing. Building on the information conservation framework, we examine how energy-information equivalence, temperature effects, and thermodynamic efficiency limits constrain information processing systems.

## Motivation
Information processing is fundamentally constrained by both Shannon's information-theoretic bounds and thermodynamic principles. Understanding these dual constraints could provide insights into:
- The relationship between energy consumption and information processing efficiency
- Fundamental limits on computational systems from thermodynamic principles
- Connections between Carnot efficiency, Shannon capacity, and Landauer's principle
- Temperature-dependent bounds on information processing capabilities

The question is: How do thermodynamic constraints interact with information-theoretic bounds to limit information processing systems?
