# CIP-0003: Integrate quimb Library for Enhanced Quantum Tensor Operations

## Summary
This CIP proposes the integration of the `quimb` (quantum information and many-body) library into the inaccessible game project. quimb provides optimized tensor network operations, advanced quantum state manipulation, and efficient algorithms that can enhance the performance and capabilities of our quantum information calculations.

*Status Update (2025-07-26)*: This CIP has been *SUPERSEDED* by the successful integration of quimb in the MEPP framework. The goals of this CIP have been achieved through the implementation in `mepp.py`, which extensively uses quimb for tensor operations, partial traces, and quantum state manipulation.

## Relationship to Current Project

- *Status*: Goals achieved through MEPP implementation
- *Current Implementation*: `mepp.py` uses `quimb` extensively for:
  - Tensor network operations (`quimb.tensor`)
  - Partial trace calculations
  - Quantum state manipulation
  - Memory-efficient operations for larger systems
- *Superseded by*: [CIP-0005](./cip0005.md) MEPP framework which includes comprehensive quimb integration
- *Future*: Additional quimb features may be integrated through [CIP-0007](./cip0007.md) Stage 3 implementation
