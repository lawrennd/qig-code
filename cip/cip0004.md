# CIP-0004: Comprehensive Test Suite Rewrite with Rigorous Tolerances

## Summary

The current test suite consists of 19 test files with inconsistent tolerances, unclear test organisation, and questionable numerical precision expectations. This CIP proposes a complete rewrite of the test suite that:

- **Standardises numerical tolerances** based on rigorous error analysis
- **Reorganises test structure** for better maintainability and coverage clarity
- **Maintains identical test coverage** while improving reliability and documentation
- **Establishes tolerance guidelines** based on mathematical precision bounds

## Motivation

The current test suite has several critical issues:

### Tolerance Inconsistencies
- Tolerances range from `1e-14` (near machine precision) to `1e-4` (4 decimal places)
- No clear rationale for tolerance choices
- Some tests use absolute tolerances, others relative, some both
- Inconsistent error bounds across similar mathematical operations

### Test Organisation Problems

- 19 test files with unclear division of responsibility
- Overlapping coverage between `test_inaccessible_game.py` (726 lines) and specialised files
- No clear mapping between tests and mathematical requirements
- Poor separation between unit tests, integration tests, and validation tests

### Numerical Precision Issues

- Tests assume numerical methods are more accurate than they actually are
- No consideration of floating-point error accumulation
- Missing error propagation analysis for complex computations

### Maintenance Burden

- Tests are hard to debug when tolerances are too strict or inconsistent
- Difficult to determine if test failures indicate real bugs or tolerance issues
- Poor documentation of what each tolerance actually validates

## Detailed Description

This CIP will establish a new test suite that maintains complete coverage while providing:

### 1. Rigorous Tolerance Framework

- **Mathematical error bounds** based on quantum algorithm precision analysis
- **Machine epsilon awareness** for floating-point operations
- **Error propagation tracking** through complex computations
- **Statistical validation** of numerical tolerances

### 2. Hierarchical Test Structure

- **Unit tests**: Core mathematical operations with tight tolerances
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end workflows with appropriate numerical bounds
- **Validation tests**: Physical/mathematical correctness with statistically meaningful thresholds

### 3. Scientifically Derived Tolerance Categories

Tolerance categories are derived from quantum algorithm precision analysis:

**Category A: Machine Precision Operations (≤ 1e-14)**

- **Mathematical basis**: Direct machine epsilon bounds (ε ≈ 2.22e-16)
- **Operations**: Matrix trace, determinant, eigenvalues for small matrices
- **Error source**: Floating-point roundoff in O(1) operations
- **Examples**: `np.trace(ρ)`, `np.linalg.det(U)` for unitary matrices
- **Justification**: Pure algebraic operations with no error accumulation

**Category B: Quantum State Properties (≤ 1e-12)**

- **Mathematical basis**: Purity constraint |trace(ρ²) - 1| < √ε ≈ 1.5e-8
- **Operations**: Hermitian verification, unit trace preservation
- **Error source**: Matrix exponentiation in exponential families
- **Examples**: `np.allclose(ρ, ρ.conj().T)`, `abs(np.trace(ρ) - 1.0)`
- **Justification**: Quantum states must satisfy fundamental constraints

**Category C: Entanglement & Information Metrics (≤ 1e-10)**

- **Mathematical basis**: von Neumann entropy sensitivity to eigenvalue perturbations
- **Operations**: Mutual information I = C - H, marginal entropy sums
- **Error source**: Partial trace operations and eigenvalue computations
- **Examples**: `abs(I - (C - H))`, marginal entropy conservation
- **Justification**: Information-theoretic quantities require high precision

**Category D: Analytical Derivatives (≤ 1e-8)**

- **Mathematical basis**: Error propagation in quantum Fisher information metric
- **Operations**: BKM metric G, Jacobian M, constraint gradients ∇C
- **Error source**: Complex derivative chains and matrix logarithms
- **Examples**: Fisher information symmetry, constraint preservation
- **Justification**: Derivatives amplify small errors in state representations

**Category E: Numerical Integration (≤ 1e-6)**

- **Mathematical basis**: ODE solver convergence and long-time stability
- **Operations**: Trajectory integration, entropy evolution over time
- **Error source**: Accumulation of integration errors over many steps
- **Examples**: Constraint preservation during dynamics, entropy monotonicity
- **Justification**: Physical conservation laws must hold over extended periods

**Category F: Physical Validation (≤ 1e-4)**

- **Mathematical basis**: Statistical significance for physical claims
- **Operations**: Optimality verification, genericity checks
- **Error source**: Parameter space exploration and optimization convergence
- **Examples**: Qutrit optimality claims, phase transition detection
- **Justification**: Research conclusions require robust statistical evidence

### 4. Absolute vs Relative Tolerance Strategy

**Absolute tolerances** for quantities with natural scales:

- Quantum state properties (trace = 1, purity bounds)
- Physical constraints (probability conservation)
- Error metrics with known bounds

**Relative tolerances** for scale-dependent quantities

- Fisher information metrics (can vary by orders of magnitude)
- Entanglement measures (depend on system size)
- Derivative magnitudes (depend on parameter scales)

**Adaptive tolerance selection**

- Small absolute tolerance floor prevents false precision
- Relative tolerance ceiling prevents overly loose bounds
- Context-aware selection based on mathematical operation type

### 5. Coverage Preservation

- Complete mapping of existing tests to new structure
- No reduction in test cases or scenarios
- Enhanced edge case coverage
- Better error message documentation

## Implementation Plan
