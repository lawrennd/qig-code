## 1. Description
Formalise the new multi-scale cascade dynamics introduced in the manuscript into a reusable framework that links Fisher information eigen-spectrum, blur-window isolation, and Hawkes-process contagion modelling.

## 2. Motivation
Recent additions to `the-inaccessible-game.tex` (§Multi-Scale Cascade Dynamics) outline a novel diagnostic but remain conceptual. A structured plan is needed to: 
* turn theory into code,
* validate on synthetic and empirical datasets, and
* integrate results seamlessly into the paper.

## 3. Goals
1. Library code (`src/ig_cascade`) for computing Fisher spectrum and mapping to Hawkes kernels.
2. Benchmark notebook and automated tests.
3. Documentation & figures injected into LaTeX.
4. Back-propagate metrics to pipeline (whats-next, dashboards).

## 4. Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase A – Design (Proposed → Accepted)**  
  * Literature gap analysis  
  * API sketch & data contracts
- **Phase B – Prototype (Accepted → Implemented)**  
  * Minimal working example on toy data  
  * CI test harness
- **Phase C – Integration**  
  * Hook into existing simulation outputs  
  * Generate plots for paper
- **Phase D – Review & Merge (Implemented → Closed)**  
  * Code review; reproduce figures  
  * Finalise manuscript changes
