# CIP-0009: Explicit Hamiltonian Extraction from Antisymmetric GENERIC Flow

## Summary

Extend the quantum inaccessible game codebase so that, for finite-dimensional examples (in particular LME qutrit and qubit pairs), the antisymmetric sector of the constrained GENERIC flow is mapped into an explicit effective Hamiltonian
\(H_{\text{eff}}(\theta)\) such that the reversible density-matrix dynamics are written directly as
\(\dot{\rho}_{\text{rev}} = -i[H_{\text{eff}}(\theta), \rho(\theta)]\).

The goal is a numerically and symbolically verifiable bridge between:

- the natural-parameter GENERIC decomposition (M = S + A), and
- the operator picture of von Neumann evolution,

using the existing `lme_numeric_symbolic_bridge.ipynb` and associated `qig` modules.

## Motivation

The origin paper shows that, under the BFLP/Parzygnat axioms and marginal-entropy constrained maximum entropy production, the antisymmetric (entropy-conserving) sector of the GENERIC decomposition must be unitary and therefore take the von Neumann form \(\dot{\rho}_{\text{rev}} = -i[H_{\text{eff}}, \rho]\).

In the current `qig-code` implementation:

- The GENERIC decomposition is implemented in natural parameter coordinates, with numerical Jacobians and symmetric/antisymmetric splitting.
- There are symbolic tools and notebooks (`lme_numeric_symbolic_bridge.ipynb`, `symbolic_vs_numerical_demo.py`) that compare analytic and numeric structure at and near the LME origin.

However, there is no end-to-end routine that:

1. Takes a concrete point \(\theta^*\) on the constraint manifold (e.g. near an LME origin),
2. Computes the Jacobian, extracts the antisymmetric part A, and
3. Solves for a concrete matrix \(H_{\text{eff}}\) in a chosen Lie-closed Hermitian basis \(\{F_a\}\),
4. Verifies numerically that the induced density-matrix flow matches the von Neumann commutator.

Having such an explicit Hamiltonian bridge would:

- Make the categorical/GEOMETRIC story in the paper computationally tangible.
- Provide a strong regression/validation target for future refactors of GENERIC/SEA code.
- Enable concrete examples in notebooks showing how the antisymmetric sector "is" a Hamiltonian in the chosen operator basis.

## Detailed Description

### Scope

Implement a small, well-scoped extension that, for selected finite-dimensional examples (starting with 2-qubit and 2-qutrit LME origins) can:

- Construct the relevant LME state and operator basis (already available in `pair_operators` and symbolic helpers).
- Choose a nearby interior point \(\theta^*\) corresponding to a regularised state (as in existing entropy-time and regularisation work).
- Compute the constrained flow Jacobian M(\(\theta^*\)), split M = S + A, and extract A.
- Use the Lie structure constants \(f_{abc}\) for the chosen basis to solve the linear system
  \(A_{ab}\theta_b = \sum_c f_{abc} \eta_c(\theta)\) for \(\eta_c(\theta)\).
- Build \(H_{\text{eff}}(\theta) = \sum_c \eta_c(\theta) F_c\) as an explicit matrix.
- Numerically verify that the reversible part of the density-matrix flow induced by A matches \(-i[H_{\text{eff}}, \rho]\) up to prescribed tolerances.

The first implementation can be example-driven (qutrit pair LME origin), with an API simple enough to generalise later.

### Design Sketch

- **Operator basis**: reuse the existing Lie-closed Hermitian bases (Pauli for qubits, Gell-Mann for qutrits) from `qig.pair_operators` / `qig.structure_constants`.
- **Structure constants**: use or extend `structure_constants` utilities to provide \(f_{abc}\) in a numerically convenient tensor form aligned with the chosen basis ordering.
- **Jacobian and A**: use the existing GENERIC decomposition code (likely in `generic_decomposition.py` / `generic.py` / `dynamics.py`) to compute M and then \(A = \tfrac{1}{2}(M - M^T)\) at \(\theta^*\).
- **Solving for \(\eta\)**:
  - Treat the relation
    \[
    A_{ab} \theta_b = \sum_c f_{abc} \eta_c
    \]
    as a linear system in \(\eta\) for fixed \(\theta\).
  - Implement a helper that, given A, \(\theta\) and \(f_{abc}\), returns \(\eta(\theta)\) (using least-squares or a small linear solve with conditioning diagnostics if the map is not square).
- **Verification**:
  - Use the exponential-family map \(\theta \mapsto \rho(\theta)\) to compute \(\partial_a \rho\) and hence the density-matrix vector field induced by A in natural parameters.
  - Separately, build \(H_{\text{eff}}\) from \(\eta\) and compute \(-i[H_{\text{eff}}, \rho]\).
  - Compare the two operators in Frobenius norm across several random perturbations \(\theta^* + q\) in a small neighbourhood.

The implementation should lean heavily on the existing symbolic/numeric bridge code to avoid duplication.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Survey and minimal refactor for reuse**
   - Identify the canonically supported finite-dimensional examples for LME states (2-qubit, 2-qutrit) in:
     - `qig/pair_operators.py`
     - `qig/structure_constants.py`
     - `qig/validation.py`
     - `examples/lme_numeric_symbolic_bridge.ipynb`
   - Confirm where the GENERIC Jacobian M and S/A decomposition are exposed:
     - `qig/generic_decomposition.py`
     - `qig/dynamics.py` and/or `qig/generic.py`.
   - If necessary, add small internal helpers (non-public API) to:
     - compute M(\(\theta\)) at a given \(\theta\), and
     - return S and A separately.

2. **Implement Hamiltonian extraction helper**
   - Add a new module or functions (e.g. `qig/generic_hamiltonian.py` or within `generic_decomposition.py`) providing:
     - `compute_antisymmetric_flow(theta, model) -> A, theta, rho` (thin wrapper around existing code).
     - `solve_eta_from_A(A, theta, f) -> eta` implementing the linear solve \(A\theta = f * \eta\).
     - `build_H_eff(eta, basis) -> H_eff` assembling \(\sum_c \eta_c F_c\).
   - Ensure these helpers:
     - Accept an explicit basis ordering and corresponding structure-constants tensor.
     - Are written with clear docstrings about assumptions (Lie closure, finite dimension, small neighbourhood of regularised LME origin).

3. **End-to-end example and notebook integration**
   - Extend `examples/lme_numeric_symbolic_bridge.ipynb` (or add a sibling notebook) to:
     - Pick a regularised 2-qutrit LME origin point \(\theta^*\).
     - Compute M, S, A.
     - Extract \(H_{\text{eff}}\) as above.
     - Numerically verify \(\dot{\rho}_{\text{rev}} \approx -i[H_{\text{eff}}, \rho]\) for several nearby \(\theta\).
   - Present the Hamiltonian both as numeric matrix and in basis-coefficient form, with comments linking back to the origin paper (equations for von Neumann flow and the role of \(f_{abc}\)).

4. **Testing and tolerances**
   - Add tests in `tests/test_generic_hamiltonian.py` (or reuse existing file of that name) to:
     - Check that for a fixed \(\theta^*\) and basis, `solve_eta_from_A` returns \(\eta\) such that the induced commutator flow matches the antisymmetric density-matrix flow within existing tolerance framework.
     - Test both 2-qubit and 2-qutrit bases (Pauli and Gell-Mann) using existing structure-constants fixtures.
     - Exercise the helper APIs with random small perturbations around \(\theta^*\), using the same tolerance machinery as other generic/SEA tests.

5. **Documentation and cross-references**
   - Add a short subsection to the theory/validation docs (e.g. in `docs/`):
     - Explaining that the antisymmetric GENERIC sector has been explicitly mapped to a Hamiltonian.
     - Pointing to the new notebook and tests.
     - Linking to the sections of the origin paper that motivate this (categorical forcing of unitarity and Lie structure constants).

## Backward Compatibility

- No public APIs need to be removed or changed; the new functionality can live behind new helper functions and/or an explicit `HamiltonianExtraction` helper.
- Existing tests and notebooks should continue to run unchanged.
- Any new public surface (if introduced) should be optional and documented; existing users who only care about entropy-time trajectories or generic decomposition do not need to update their code.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**:
  - Compare the antisymmetric density-matrix vector field computed via natural parameters + Kubo-Mori derivatives with the commutator \(-i[H_{\text{eff}}, \rho]\) for 2-qubit and 2-qutrit examples.
  - Verify numerical stability of `solve_eta_from_A` (condition numbers, behaviour under small perturbations of \(\theta\)).
- **Regression tests**:
  - Integrate with existing `test_generic_hamiltonian.py` / `test_generic_decomposition_*` to ensure no regressions in M, S, A calculations.
- **Notebook tests**:
  - Use the existing `test_notebook.py` harness to ensure the updated/added notebook runs cleanly and reproduces the expected Hamiltonian coefficients within tolerance.

## Related Requirements

This CIP is motivated by and helps validate the following conceptual requirements from the origin paper and the broader project:

- **Categorical forcing of unitarity**: Reversible, entropy-conserving morphisms must be unitary, implying von Neumann dynamics for the antisymmetric sector.
- **Lie-algebraic representation**: The chosen Hermitian basis forms a Lie algebra with structure constants \(f_{abc}\), which should be visible in the mapping from A to \(H_{\text{eff}}\).
- **Entropy-time / real-time unification**: Show explicitly, in code, how the same constrained information-geometric flow decomposes into unitary (real-time) and dissipative (entropy-time) components.

Specifically, this CIP implements a concrete realisation of:

- The claim that the antisymmetric GENERIC sector is exactly von Neumann evolution in finite dimensions.
- The mapping from natural-parameter antisymmetric tensor A and structure constants \(f_{abc}\) to an effective Hamiltonian.
