# CIP-0005: Quantum Thermalization via Random Phase-String Gates and Coarse Graining

## Status
- [x] Proposed → Initial implementation complete
- [ ] Accepted → Working simulation with coarse graining
- [ ] Implemented → SEA implementation needs fixing
- [ ] Closed → Ready for review

## Description

This CIP documents the implementation of a quantum thermalization simulation using Marginal-Preserving Phase-String  gates and Statistical Ensemble Averaging (SEA). The key insight is that maximum entropy increase comes from *coarse graining effects* rather than starting with mixed states. The idea is to show that this provides a mechanism for a state 1 pure dephasing of the initial pure quantum system enabling stage 2 isolation process to follow.

## Motivation

Understanding quantum thermalization requires:
1. *Proper entropy dynamics*: How does entropy emerge from pure quantum evolution?
2. *Coarse graining effects*: How does tracing out part of a system create effective entropy?
3. *SEA validation*: Does Statistical Ensemble Averaging capture the coarse-grained behavior?

The simulation demonstrates that random quantum gates on a pure state create correlations that become visible as entropy when we coarse grain by partial tracing.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. *Random Phase-String Gates*: Unitary operations using Pauli strings with random phases
2. *Coarse Graining*: Partial trace over subsystem to create effective mixed states
3. *SEA Evolution*: Statistical ensemble averaging for comparison
4. *Entropy Tracking*: Von Neumann entropy of coarse-grained states

### Physics Implementation

- *Initial State*: Pure state (zero entropy)
- *Evolution*: Random unitary gates preserve purity
- *Coarse Graining*: Partial trace reveals effective entropy
- *Result*: Entropy fluctuations show quantum correlations

## Implementation Status

### In Progress 🔄
- [ ] Random phase-string gate generation - [ ] Proper partial trace implementation for coarse graining
- [ ] Von Neumann entropy calculation with numerical stability
- [ ] Pure state initialization and unitary evolution
- [ ] Entropy tracking during evolution
- [ ] Qubit and qutrit system support

## Key Insights

1. *Coarse Graining Entropy*: The entropy increase comes from tracing out part of the system, not from starting with mixed states
2. *Pure State Evolution*: Unitary gates preserve purity; entropy emerges from effective description
3. *Numerical Stability*: Proper eigenvalue handling prevents negative entropy values
4. *System Size Effects*: Larger systems show more robust entropy dynamics

## Technical Details

### Coarse Graining Implementation
```python
# Trace over first subsystem_size qubits
subsystem_dim = self.d * subsystem_size
remaining_dim = self.d * (self.n_qubits - subsystem_size)
rho_tensor = rho.reshape(subsystem_dim, remaining_dim, subsystem_dim, remaining_dim)
rho_reduced = np.zeros((remaining_dim, remaining_dim), dtype=complex)
for i in range(subsystem_dim):
    rho_reduced += rho_tensor[i, :, i, :]
```

### Random Gate Generation
```python
# Random Pauli strings with phase factors
pauli_types = ['x', 'y', 'z']  # Non-diagonal operations
gate = expm(1j * alpha * pauli_string)
```
