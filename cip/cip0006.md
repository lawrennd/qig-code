# CIP-0006: Update AISTATS Paper Draft to Jaynes/Natural-Parameter Framework

## Status Checklist
- [x] Proposed → Ready *(completed 2025-07-27)*
- [x] Accepted → Major restructuring *approved*
- [ ] Implemented → Paper rewritten with new framework *(in progress - 60% complete)*
- [ ] Closed → Final draft ready for submission

**Overall CIP status:** 🚧 *In Progress* (Phase 1 – structural scaffolding + major electroweak expansion completed)

## Description

Restructure the AISTATS paper draft to align with the new Jaynes/natural-parameter MEPP framework. The current draft needs to map from the axiomatic foundation through two-stage dynamics (dephasing → isolation) to emergent physics, using consistent SEA dynamics in canonical coordinates.

## Tenet Alignment

This CIP directly implements several core tenets of The Inaccessible Game project. *Natural Parameters as Canonical Coordinates* is central to the restructuring, as the entire paper must consistently use θ_j = log p_j - ψ coordinates throughout. *Two-Stage Evolution: Dephasing to Isolation* provides the fundamental narrative structure, with Stage 1 (dephasing) and Stage 2 (isolation) as the primary organizing principle. *Steepest Entropy Ascent as Dynamics* drives the mathematical framework, with θ̇ = -G_∥θ as the core dynamical equation. *Emergent Physics from Information Geometry* guides the presentation of how gauge theories, particles, and symmetries arise from Fisher geometry rather than fundamental assumptions. *Information Conservation as Foundation* ensures the axiomatic basis remains clear, while *Mathematical Rigor and Systematic Investigation* requires distinguishing between rigorous derivations and speculative extensions in the paper structure.

## Motivation

The breakthrough to the two-stage perspective (dephasing, isolation) with Fisher eigenvalue hierarchy fundamentally changes how the story flows from information axioms to emergent physics. The paper needs to:

1. *Separate axioms from dynamics* clearly
2. *Present the two-stage evolution* as the central narrative 
3. *Use Jaynes natural parameters* consistently throughout
4. *Show emergent gauge theory and particles* as consequences of Fisher geometry

### Deep Dive: Surace's "Theory of Inaccessible Information" Complementarity

#### Conceptual Convergence Analysis

*TL;DR*: Surace's work provides the rigorous logical-lattice foundation for the first layer of the Inaccessible Game, while IG extends this into concrete thermodynamic dynamics and emergent physics.

| *Aspect* | *Surace (2024)* | *Inaccessible Game* |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| *Guiding Hypothesis* | Inaccessibility Hypothesis (IH): some statements fundamentally untestable | Information-isolation axiom: zero mutual information between observer and system |
| *Basic Constraint* | Every accessible statement = union of $d$ inaccessible atomic statements | Sum of marginal entropies fixed: Σᵢhᵢ = const ⇒ I + H conserved |
| *Mathematical Setting* | Finite Boolean lattice; quasi-probabilities via Cox/Jaynes derivation | Category-theoretic information-loss functionals (Baez & Fritz) |
| *Key Measure* | Inaccessibility measure χc(p) = (Σᵢpᵢᶜ)^(1/(1-c)) | Same χ₂ used for configuration ranking and E3 unit motivation |
| *Minimal Model* | d=2 ⇒ qubit as simplest accessible system | d=3 ⇒ qutrit E3 pair as optimal information-atom |

#### Points of Strong Resonance

1. *Logical → Quasi-Probability Lift*
   - Both start from classical propositional logic
   - Relax truth values to obtain quasi-probability calculus
   - Allow negative/supra-unit values in inaccessible subspaces

2. *Multiplicative Ignorance Metric*
   - Surace's χc family (especially χ₂ = 1/Σpᵢ²) 
   - Exactly matches IG's inaccessibility metric for entropy production maximization
   - Provides rigorous foundation for partition selection

3. *Emergence Without Observers*
   - Both sidestep Born rule/measurement postulate
   - Inaccessible information cannot be decohered by outside observer
   - Probability = entanglement entropy from external viewpoint

#### Strategic Divergence & Complementarity

| *Framework Scope* | *Surace* | *Inaccessible Game* |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| *Scope* | Foundational/algebraic - stops after deriving qubit | Dynamical/thermodynamic - entropy-time, Fisher flow, emergent physics |
| *Dynamics* | Static lattice (no dynamics specified) | MaxEP subject to I+H=const drives quantum→classical evolution |
| *Particles* | Qubit = depth-2 block | E3 qutrit pair as information-atom with SU(3) stabilizer |
| *Geometry* | Not addressed | Swap-history coarse-graining → metric, inertial frames, symplectic structure |
| *Cosmology* | Out of scope | Dark sector as stalled vs fixed information reservoirs |

#### Integration Opportunities for AISTATS Paper

##### Foundation Enhancement
- [ ] *Axiom Formalization*: Replace hand-wavy "marginal-entropy conservation" with Surace's IH in d-depth lattices
- [ ] *Derive Conservation Laws*: Use lattice algebra to derive same conservation principles more rigorously
- [ ] *Shared Inaccessibility Measure*: Use χ₂({pᵢ}) as bridge between static models and dynamical flow

##### Extension Pathways
- [ ] *Beyond Qubit*: Let d vary, impose IG's entropy-per-slot optimality → predicts qutrit pair (d=3)
- [ ] *Fisher-χ₂ Connection*: Show Fisher information metric as gradient of χ₂ measure
- [ ] *Higher Depths*: Systematic exploration of d=4,5,... using Surace's framework

##### Paper Positioning Strategy
- [ ] *Introduction*: Position IG as "dynamical completion" of Surace's foundational work
- [ ] *Axioms Section*: Reference Surace for rigorous logical-lattice backing
- [ ] *Stage 1*: Connect d=3 choice to Surace's depth optimization
- [ ] *Discussion*: Outline unified research programme: lattices → dynamics → emergent physics

#### Unified Research Programme Vision

The complementary frameworks suggest a complete research pathway:

1. *Logical Lattices* (Surace) → *Quasi-Probabilities* → *Multiplicative Inaccessibility*
2. *Depth-3 Optimization* → *E3 Units* → *SU(3) Stabilizer Structure*  
3. *Fisher Dynamics* → *Classical Entropy* → *Emergent Spacetime & Gauge Fields*

#### Implementation Tasks

##### Literature Integration Updates
- [ ] Add Surace comparison paragraph in Introduction
- [ ] Reference logical-lattice foundation in Axioms section
- [ ] Connect d=3 choice to Surace's depth analysis
- [ ] Propose unified framework in Discussion/Future Work

##### Strategic Citation Enhancement  
- [ ] Position as "dynamical extension of Surace's foundational work"
- [ ] Highlight complementary strengths: rigorous foundations + physical dynamics
- [ ] Suggest future collaboration opportunities

##### Mathematical Connections
- [ ] Show χ₂ measure bridges static lattice and dynamical flow
- [ ] Connect quasi-probability calculus to natural parameter coordinates
- [ ] Demonstrate d=3 optimality using both frameworks

This analysis significantly strengthens the theoretical foundation and positions the work within a broader research programme that spans foundational logic to emergent cosmology.

## Critical Gaps & De-Risking Requirements
