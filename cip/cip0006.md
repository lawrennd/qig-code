# CIP-0006: Update AISTATS Paper Draft to Jaynes/Natural-Parameter Framework

## Status Checklist
- [x] Proposed → Ready *(completed 2025-07-27)*
- [x] Accepted → Major restructuring *approved*
- [ ] Implemented → Paper rewritten with new framework *(in progress)*
- [ ] Closed → Final draft ready for submission

**Overall CIP status:** 🚧 *In Progress* (Phase 1 – structural scaffolding inserted)

## Description

Restructure the AISTATS paper draft to align with the new Jaynes/natural-parameter MEPP framework. The current draft needs to map from the axiomatic foundation through two-stage dynamics (dephasing → isolation) to emergent physics, using consistent SEA dynamics in canonical coordinates.

## Motivation

The breakthrough to the two-stage perspective (dephasing, isolation) with Fisher eigenvalue hierarchy fundamentally changes how the story flows from information axioms to emergent physics. The paper needs to:

1. *Separate axioms from dynamics* clearly
2. *Present the two-stage evolution* as the central narrative 
3. *Use Jaynes natural parameters* consistently throughout
4. *Show emergent gauge theory and particles* as consequences of Fisher geometry

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Major Structural Changes 📚

#### M-1: Split Information Isolation Section
- [ ] *Section A: Axioms & State Space*
  - Keep exchangeability + Baez + Parzygnat foundations
  - Introduce natural parameter coordinates θ_j = log p_j - ψ
  - Define hard vs soft constraints clearly
  
- [ ] *Section B: Two-Stage Entropy Dynamics*
  - Introduce Dephasing vs Isolation stages
  - Present SEA flow: θ̇ = -G_∥θ in natural parameters
  - Establish Fisher eigenvalue hierarchy → plateaus

#### M-2: Create Information Geometry Preliminaries Box
- [ ] Move Submodularity + Noether to ≤½-page summary
- [ ] Place after Axioms, before Dynamics
- [ ] Detailed derivations → Appendix A

#### M-3: Stage 1 - Dephasing Subsection
- [ ] Define block channel with random phase gates
- [ ] Show emergence of diagonal state
- [ ] Present Z-only gates and dephasing rate γ
- [ ] Justify Generalised Bell pair initialisation of qutrits through maximum gradient

#### M-4: Stage 2 - Isolation & SEA Subsection  
- [ ] Present SEA ODE in natural parameters: θ̇ = -G_∥θ
- [ ] Explain Fisher eigenspectrum hierarchy ⇒ plateau
- [ ] Introduce Gauss law & SU(3) stabilizer emergence
- [ ] Connect to charge classification (hard/soft)

#### M-5: Stage 3 - Long Plateau & Quasi-Symmetries
- [ ] Consolidate "Classical Emergence" → "Information Flow Optimization"
- [ ] Focus on sloppy Fisher modes and effective SU(2)×U(1)
- [ ] Present approximate charges and conservation laws
- [ ] Show Lorentz dispersion ω² = c²k² + m²

#### M-6: Beyond Plateau - Spatial Metrics & Particles
- [ ] Combine "Temporal Entanglement" + "Emergent Geometry"
- [ ] Add roadmap paragraph for spatial coarse-graining
- [ ] Present normal modes as particle excitations
- [ ] Keep speculative geometry separate from core results

#### M-7: Streamline Mathematical Proofs
- [ ] Trim long convex-linearity proofs to 3-line summary
- [ ] Move Parzygnat proof sketches to Appendix B
- [ ] Keep main text readable within 8 AISTATS pages

#### M-8: Update Abstract & Introduction
- [ ] Mention four information axioms explicitly
- [ ] Highlight two dynamical stages + long plateau
- [ ] Emphasize emergent SU(3) → SU(2)×U(1) symmetry breaking
- [ ] Present Lorentz & particle modes as Fisher eigenmodes

### NEW CRITICAL GAP TASKS (added 2025-07-27)

#### M-0: Mathematical Rigor Essentials  
*These were flagged by reviewer-style self-checks and added directly as TODOs in the LaTeX draft.*

- [ ] *M-0.1 Formal SEA equation block* – insert precise equation set (θ̇ = -Π G⁻¹∇S, Fisher metric) with Beretta citation.  *(TODO tags ≈ lines 600)*
- [ ] *M-0.2 Fisher spectrum footnote* – first mention must define λ_max / λ_min notation clearly.  *(TODO tag ≈ 450)*
- [ ] *M-0.3 Figure placeholders* – entropy curve, Fisher eigenvalue chart.  *(TODO tags at end of Stage 2 & Stage 3 sections)*

These sit logically before M-3/M-4 content writing and must be satisfied for referee acceptance.

---

### Phase 2: Content Refinements ✏️

#### Title & Abstract Updates
- [ ] *Proposed Title*: "The Inaccessible Game: From Dephasing to Isolation by Steepest-Entropy-Ascent"
- [ ] *Abstract Line 3*: "...derive the dynamics via a two-stage dephasing/isolation process that follows steepest-entropy-ascent."

#### Mathematical Consistency
- [ ] Change variable H → S for joint entropy throughout

- [ ] *Entropic Dynamics*: Reference Caticha for philosophical backing that mechanics can be pure inference
- [ ] *Fisher Geometry*: Connect to Vanchurin & Swingle for emergent curvature and holography
- [ ] *Gauge Emergence*: Position relative to Qi & Walter's stabilizer approach

- [ ] Reference Caticha's entropic dynamics in philosophical motivation
- [ ] Connect Fisher eigenvalue hierarchy to Amari's information geometry
- [ ] Compare gauge emergence mechanism with Qi & Walter's approach

### Deep Dive: Surace's "Theory of Inaccessible Information" Complementarity

#### Conceptual Convergence Analysis

*TL;DR*: Surace's work provides the rigorous logical-lattice foundation for the first layer of the Inaccessible Game, while IG extends this into concrete thermodynamic dynamics and emergent physics.

| *Aspect* | *Surace (2024)* | *Inaccessible Game* |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| *Guiding Hypothesis* | Inaccessibility Hypothesis (IH): some statements fundamentally untestable | Information-isolation axiom: zero mutual information between observer and system |
| *Basic Constraint* | Every accessible statement = union of $d$ inaccessible atomic statements | Sum of marginal entropies fixed: Σᵢhᵢ = const ⇒ I + H conserved |
| *Mathematical Setting* | Finite Boolean lattice; quasi-probabilities via Cox/Jaynes derivation | Category-theoretic information-loss functionals (Baez & Fritz) |
| *Key Measure* | Inaccessibility measure χc(p) = (Σᵢpᵢᶜ)^(1/(1-c)) | Same χ₂ used for configuration ranking and E3 unit motivation |
| *Minimal Model* | d=2 ⇒ qubit as simplest accessible system | d=3 ⇒ qutrit E3 pair as optimal information-atom |

#### Points of Strong Resonance

1. *Logical → Quasi-Probability Lift*
   - Both start from classical propositional logic
   - Relax truth values to obtain quasi-probability calculus
   - Allow negative/supra-unit values in inaccessible subspaces

2. *Multiplicative Ignorance Metric*
   - Surace's χc family (especially χ₂ = 1/Σpᵢ²) 
   - Exactly matches IG's inaccessibility metric for entropy production maximization
   - Provides rigorous foundation for partition selection

3. *Emergence Without Observers*
   - Both sidestep Born rule/measurement postulate
   - Inaccessible information cannot be decohered by outside observer
   - Probability = entanglement entropy from external viewpoint

#### Strategic Divergence & Complementarity

| *Framework Scope* | *Surace* | *Inaccessible Game* |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| *Scope* | Foundational/algebraic - stops after deriving qubit | Dynamical/thermodynamic - entropy-time, Fisher flow, emergent physics |
| *Dynamics* | Static lattice (no dynamics specified) | MaxEP subject to I+H=const drives quantum→classical evolution |
| *Particles* | Qubit = depth-2 block | E3 qutrit pair as information-atom with SU(3) stabilizer |
| *Geometry* | Not addressed | Swap-history coarse-graining → metric, inertial frames, symplectic structure |
| *Cosmology* | Out of scope | Dark sector as stalled vs fixed information reservoirs |

#### Integration Opportunities for AISTATS Paper

##### Foundation Enhancement
- [ ] *Axiom Formalization*: Replace hand-wavy "marginal-entropy conservation" with Surace's IH in d-depth lattices
- [ ] *Derive Conservation Laws*: Use lattice algebra to derive same conservation principles more rigorously
- [ ] *Shared Inaccessibility Measure*: Use χ₂({pᵢ}) as bridge between static models and dynamical flow

##### Extension Pathways
- [ ] *Beyond Qubit*: Let d vary, impose IG's entropy-per-slot optimality → predicts qutrit pair (d=3)
- [ ] *Fisher-χ₂ Connection*: Show Fisher information metric as gradient of χ₂ measure
- [ ] *Higher Depths*: Systematic exploration of d=4,5,... using Surace's framework

##### Paper Positioning Strategy
- [ ] *Introduction*: Position IG as "dynamical completion" of Surace's foundational work
- [ ] *Axioms Section*: Reference Surace for rigorous logical-lattice backing
- [ ] *Stage 1*: Connect d=3 choice to Surace's depth optimization
- [ ] *Discussion*: Outline unified research programme: lattices → dynamics → emergent physics

#### Unified Research Programme Vision

The complementary frameworks suggest a complete research pathway:

1. *Logical Lattices* (Surace) → *Quasi-Probabilities* → *Multiplicative Inaccessibility*
2. *Depth-3 Optimization* → *E3 Units* → *SU(3) Stabilizer Structure*  
3. *Fisher Dynamics* → *Classical Entropy* → *Emergent Spacetime & Gauge Fields*

#### Implementation Tasks

##### Literature Integration Updates
- [ ] Add Surace comparison paragraph in Introduction
- [ ] Reference logical-lattice foundation in Axioms section
- [ ] Connect d=3 choice to Surace's depth analysis
- [ ] Propose unified framework in Discussion/Future Work

##### Strategic Citation Enhancement  
- [ ] Position as "dynamical extension of Surace's foundational work"
- [ ] Highlight complementary strengths: rigorous foundations + physical dynamics
- [ ] Suggest future collaboration opportunities

##### Mathematical Connections
- [ ] Show χ₂ measure bridges static lattice and dynamical flow
- [ ] Connect quasi-probability calculus to natural parameter coordinates
- [ ] Demonstrate d=3 optimality using both frameworks

This analysis significantly strengthens the theoretical foundation and positions the work within a broader research programme that spans foundational logic to emergent cosmology.

## Critical Gaps & De-Risking Requirements

### Assessment: 85-90% Complete, Key Mathematical Rigor Needed

*Short Answer*: Excellent roadmap, but AISTATS submission requires: (i) crystallized *core claims as theorems/propositions* with minimal proofs, (ii) precise *Jaynes/natural-parameter SEA equation* (projection, metric, constraints), (iii) tight *ML-facing contribution list + simulations*, and (iv) clear *separation of speculative material* to appendix.

### Phase 0: Mathematical Backbone (CRITICAL - Must Complete First)

- [ ] *Proposition 3 (Plateau Hierarchy)*: Fisher eigengaps ⇒ metastable plateaus/quasi-symmetries 
- [ ] *Proposition 4 (SU(3) → SU(2)×U(1))*: Minimal algebraic statement for stabilizer mechanism
- [ ] *Proposition 5 (Lorentz Dispersion)*: Conditions for Fisher normal modes yielding ω² = c²k² + m²

#### B. SEA vs NGD vs MEPP Triangle - Clarification Required
