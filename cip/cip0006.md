# CIP-0006: Update AISTATS Paper Draft

## Summary

The current draft of the paper has the right start, but needs to map through to the entropy dynamics correctly. This CIP looks at a set of suggested changes to the current paper draft. 

## Motivation

The new two stage perspective (dephasing, isolation) significantly changes the way the story maps to the entropy maximisation change. 

## Detailed Description

Two sets of changes recommended, one structural to tell the main story and then the second the minor edits required. 
More detailed explanation of the proposed improvement, including technical details.

## Implementation Plan

Start with the main structure and then polish.

1. *Step 1*: Major Changes
  - [ ] M-1	Split the present “INFORMATION ISOLATION” section into two new sections A. Axioms & State Space (keep exchangeability + Baez + Parzygnat stuff). B. Two-Stage Entropy Dynamics (introduce Dephasing vs Isolation, SEA flow on natural parameters, Fisher hierarchy).	Keeps axioms separate from dynamics; readers won’t get lost in mid-stream.
  - [ ] M-2	Move Submodularity + Noether paragraphs to a “Preliminaries: Information Geometry” box (after Axioms, before Dynamics). Summarise them in ≤½-page; detailed derivations can go to an appendix.	Lets the main thread flow: Axioms → (short) geometry intro → Stage-1/Stage-2 story.
  - [ ] M-3	Insert an explicit “Stage-1: Dephasing” subsection just after new section B starts.Give: definition of block channel, emergence of diagonal state, Z-only gates, rate γ.	Readers need to see exactly how quantum coherences are erased before Isolation starts.
  - [ ] M-4	Insert “Stage-2: Isolation & SEA” subsection. • Present SEA ODE in natural parameters \dot\theta=-G_{\!\parallel}\theta.• State Fisher eigen-spectrum hierarchy ⇒ plateau.• Point out Gauss law & SU (3) stabiliser.	Makes the new story explicit; anchors later SU(2)×U(1) and Lorentz claims.
  - [ ] M-5	Pull everything from “Classical Emergence” (§ 3) down to “Information Flow Optimisation” into a single “Stage-3: Long Plateau & Quasi-Symmetries” section.Focus on: sloppy mode, effective SU(2)×U(1), approximate charges, Lorentz dispersion.	Removes repetition; aligns narrative with three stages.
  - [ ] M-6	Move the current “TEMPORAL ENTANGLEMENT” + “EMERGENT GEOMETRY” into a single “Beyond the Plateau: Spatial Metrics & Particles” section near the end.Add one roadmap paragraph at its head: why we now coarse-grain spatially.	Keeps speculative geometry separate from core derivations; readers can stop earlier if they just need the entropy result.
  - [ ] M-7	Trim or appendix-out long convex-linearity / Parzygnat proof sketches (≈¶¶ 3–8 of current § 2.4).  Replace in main text with a 3-line summary + “details in App. A”.	Main paper stays readable within 8 AISTATS pages; math aficionados still get proofs.
  - [ ] M-8	Rewrite Abstract & Intro bullets to mention explicitly: • four axioms,• two dynamical stages (+ long plateau),• emergent SU(3)→SU(2)×U(1),• Lorentz & particle modes as standing waves.	Signals to reviewers that paper now tells a clean dephasing/isolation story.

2. *Step 2*: Major Changes
  - [ ] Title	Consider “The Inaccessible Game: From Dephasing to Isolation by Steepest-Entropy-Ascent”.
  - [ ] Abstract line 3	“…derive the dynamics via a two-stage dephasing/isolation process that follows steepest-entropy-ascent.”
  - [ ] Intro, ¶ 3 (“Revisiting Entropy”)	Add one sentence at end: “We will later show that, after dephasing, Baez’s axioms act on the diagonal state’s natural parameters.”
  - [ ] § 2.2 “Submodularity”	Insert parenthetical: “(detailed proof relegated to App. B to keep the flow).”
  Equation after ‘Now by seeing the multiinformation…’ (top of p. 6)	Change variable H→S for joint entropy to avoid later switch; define \tau as “entropy time” right there.
  - [ ] Paragraph starting “The introduction of time allows us…”	Move to new Stage-1 section; clarify that potential = I, kinetic = S (joint).
  Convex-linearity discussion (pp. 7–8)	Shorten main text; move derivation of negative conditional entropy to appendix.
  § 3 “Classical Emergence”, first two paragraphs	Begin with explicit bullet list: “Given (i) dephasing, (ii) fixed marginals, the only way to increase S is to …”.
  - [ ] Equation (C/R)	Show maximisation in one line, move derivation to App. C.
  - [ ] “Partition” subsection	Now belongs under Stage-2; prefix with “During Isolation…”.
  - [ ] “Information Flow Optimisation”	Replace first sentence with: “We now cast the SEA equation in Jaynes natural parameters.”
  - [ ] All “S_A=S_B” lines	Call it “entanglement entropy S_{\text{ent}}” once, then use S_{\text{ent}}.
  - [ ] TEMPORAL ENTANGLEMENT	State clearly that E3 dimers are SU (3) singlets; reference figure.  Remove Burnside/Humphreys historical footnote (not needed).
  - [ ] EMERGENT GEOMETRY: first paragraph	Begin with “Once the plateau is coarse-grained into cells, the Fisher metric acts like a Laplacian …”.
  - [ ] Figure 1 caption	Update bullet labels to new section names (“Stage 1 Dephasing”; “Stage 2 Isolation”; “Stage 3 Plateau”).
  - [ ] Appendix labels	A = Baez/Parzygnat proofs; B = submodularity spectral lemma; C = Origin-configuration maximiser; D = Simulator pseudocode (optional).
  - [ ] References	Add Caticha (2012), Vanchurin (2021) for entropic dynamics / Fisher gravity; update any missing years.
  
3. *Step 3*: polish
  - [ ] Use small-caps or bold to tag axioms, stages, hard vs soft constraints the first time they appear.
  - [ ] Add a figure showing entropy curve with plateau (e.g. from your simulator) in Stage-3 section.
  - [ ] Provide a one-page “Jaynes cheat-sheet” in the appendix: definition of natural parameters, Fisher matrix, SEA ODE.

4. *Step 4*: Page Budget
  - Intro + Axioms	1.3
  - Prelim Info Geometry	0.5
  - Stage 1 Dephasing	0.8
  - Stage 2 Isolation / SEA	1.2
  - Stage 3 Plateau & quasi-sym	1.0
  - Emergent Geometry & Particles	1.0
  - Discussion & Related	0.7
  - Figures	0.5
  - Total	≈7.0 pp
  - Leaving ≈1 page margin for new ideas

### Implementation 
- [ ] Create new section headers: \section{Stage 1: Dephasing}, …
- [ ] Cut-paste existing maths into new slots; move proofs to appendices.
- [ ]	Run LaTeX, count pages, prune again.
- [ ] Regenerate Figure 1 with updated arrows.
- [ ]	Update abstract + intro bullets.
- [ ]	Drop simulator results into Stage 3 figure.


## Backward Compatibility

Changes need to be reflected in updates of `mepp.py` code.
