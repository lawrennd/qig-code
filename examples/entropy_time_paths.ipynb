    "\n",
    "The [boring game dynamics](boring_game_dynamics.ipynb) showed that starting from the LME origin with isotropic regularisation ($\\rho_\\varepsilon = (1-\\varepsilon)\\rho_{\\text{Bell}} + \\varepsilon I/D$), the constrained and unconstrained dynamics coincide. This document shows that.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The \"boring\" is an artifact of isotropic regularisation**, not an intrinsic property of the origin.\n",
    "2. **Entropy time** provides a natural way to analyse the origin without explicit regularisation, via a L'Hôpital-style limit.\n",
    "3. **Different departure directions** (different $\\sigma$) reveal a rich family of paths emanating from the same pure-state origin.\n",
    "4. **The north pole analogy**: The LME origin is like a coordinate singularity at the north pole—many distinct trajectories all appear to start from the same point.\n",
    "5. **The origin may be an illusion**: Looking backward from any interior state, trajectories appear to originate from the pure Bell state, but different paths (different $\\sigma$) represent genuinely different histories that share the same asymptotic boundary.\n",
    "6. **The \"almost-null\" direction**: Near the pure state, the BKM metric develops an almost-null direction aligned with $\\theta$. In game time this causes freezing; in entropy time it causes dramatic parameter motion.\n",

    "### The deeper insight: Did you really start at the origin?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No explicit regularisation is needed** to define the flow at the boundary—L'Hôpital-style limits in entropy time give well-defined tangent directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The limiting direction depends on how you approach** the boundary. Different $\\sigma$ = different \"meridian\" from the north pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Many inequivalent interior trajectories share the same origin**—like many meridians meeting at the north pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The \"almost-null\" direction of the BKM metric** is where all the action is:\n",
    "   - In game time: flow freezes along this direction\n",
    "   - In entropy time: flow **explodes** along this direction (huge $\\theta$ motion for unit entropy change)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The origin may be an illusion**: it's not a unique physical starting point but a shared asymptotic boundary where different histories converge. The game isn't \"starting from the origin\" but rather \"which path through state space are you on?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"boring\" game revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "The game from the LME origin with isotropic regularisation is boring because:\n",
    "- The symmetric $\\sigma = \\tfrac{\\mathbf{I}}{D}$ respects all symmetries of the Bell state\n",
    "- This picks out a unique, maximally symmetric departure direction\n",
    "- The constraint gradient vanishes, so $\\Pi_\\parallel = \\mathbf{I}$ throughout\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is an artifact of the regularisation choice, not an intrinsic property. With entropy time and anisotropic $\\sigma$, the origin reveals a rich tangent cone of possible departures, the game is only boring if you choose to make it so."
