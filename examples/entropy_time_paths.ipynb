        "3. **Different departure directions** (different $\\sigma$) reveal a rich family of paths emanating from the same pure-state origin.\n",
        "4. **The north pole analogy**: The LME origin is like a coordinate singularity at the north pole—many distinct trajectories all appear to start from the same point.\n",
        "5. **The origin may be an illusion**: Looking backward from any interior state, trajectories appear to originate from the pure Bell state, but different paths (different $\\sigma$) represent genuinely different histories that share the same asymptotic boundary.\n",
